For example, if we want to direct to the `div` element within the HTML document whose `id` attribute is `\"uid\"`, then we could write the XPath string `'//div[@id=\"uid\"]'`. The first part of this string, `//div`, first looks at all `div` elements in the HTML document. Then, using the brackets, we specify that we want only the `div` element with a specific `id` attribute (in this case `uid`). To note, the phrase `@id=\"uid\"` in the brackets would be read as \"attribute `id` equals `uid`\".\n",
